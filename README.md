### Room Name Syntax?

Thinking `roomname-floortypes-doordirections` so an example would be `chapel-ga-1000` for room name `Chapel` available for `Ground`/`Attic` and door direction of `North`/`Top`. The door directions would be based on `NESW` `North`, `East`, `South`, `West` or `Top`, `Right`, `Bottom`, `Left` like how CSS handles directional based inputs
